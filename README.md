# Object Detection System 

• Object recognition is refers to a collection of related tasks for identifying objects in digital photographs or videos. <br>
• This project is based on detecting objects in digital videos using the YOLO algorithm. <br>
• This project was developed to determine the objects with displayed accuracy for selected video in real-time using machine learning algorithm YOLO.<br>
• It was built using Python and Machine Learning with Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV and YOLO algorithm technologies.<br> 
• This project takes a video file as input and provides real-time object detection with accuracy levels using modules.
